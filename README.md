# Github Followers

A native iOS application which consumes Github Followers API and displays the 
list of followers of searched user 

## App Premise:

- The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
- The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
- The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower. 
- The user is able to save favorite username searches so they donâ€™t have to type them every time. This persists between app launches.
